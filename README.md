# Welcome traveler 🧙‍♂️

You may know me as ***Iggy The Axolotl 🦎***

Content creator on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@IggyTheAxolotl)** and **[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/IggyTheAxolotl)**, ironically struggling with technology.

## What do I do?

### **Everything.**

Doing silly stuff and anything that comes into my mind is my philosophy.

Be **dumb**. Be **silly**. Write whatever is **fun**.

- Is it needed? **Absolutely not.**
- Is it fun? **ABSOLUTELY YES 🔥🔥🔥**

## What do I use?

### **Everything.**

Going from high to low level languages in order to create whatever that I need to do.

You may find **Unity** work, **python** servers, **front-end** apps and many other **weird** stuff that I thought were cool.

## Something about me?

- I live under the water, please help me. ***bul bul bul 🫧*** 
- ***Axolotl 🦎*** is my spirit animal. **Silly**, **lazy** and **happy** all the time.
